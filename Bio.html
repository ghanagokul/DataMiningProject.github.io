            <h2>Ghana Gokul</h2>
            <p>I’m currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I’m honing my skills in data mining, statistics, and advanced analytics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from PES University, Bengaluru, India, where I developed a strong foundation in data science, deep learning, natural language processing, and data visualization.

Professionally, I’ve worked as a Business Analyst at Genpact Pvt Ltd, where I specialized in campaign management, data-driven decision-making, and process automation using tools like SAS and SQL. I have extensive experience in automating manual processes, streamlining campaign execution, and collaborating closely with data analytics teams to ensure quality control and precision.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am passionate about solving real-world problems through data. My current projects range from tourism data mining in Colorado to building an innovative app that reduces vehicle maintenance anxiety for first-time owners and older vehicle users by providing tailored maintenance advice.

I’m excited about opportunities where I can apply my expertise in business analysis, data science, and automation to create meaningful solutions.</p>
