            <h2>Ghana Gokul</h2>
            <p>I’m a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a background in Computer Science from PES University, India, where I developed skills in data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization.

Previously, I worked as a Business Analyst at Genpact, focusing on campaign management and process automation using tools like SAS and SQL. I enjoy solving real-world problems through data and have experience in streamlining workflows and collaborating with teams to improve efficiency.

I’m currently working on projects like mining air quality data in Colorado and developing an app to help car owners manage vehicle maintenance. I’m passionate about using data to create practical solutions.</p>
