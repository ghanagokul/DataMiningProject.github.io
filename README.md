# Data_Mining_Project

Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data across different regions to uncover pollution trends, understand the impact of harmful pollutants, and provide actionable insights for environmental improvements. By leveraging advanced data mining techniques, the project aims to inform public health policies and contribute to creating cleaner, healthier communities.

Motivation:
Air pollution is a growing concern worldwide, with significant effects on public health and the environment. Accurate analysis of air quality data is crucial to identify high-risk areas, monitor pollutant levels, and shape policies for reducing pollution. This project seeks to offer a data-driven approach to address these challenges by analyzing various pollutants and their trends.

Features:
Comprehensive Data Collection: The project integrates datasets from multiple sources to provide a complete view of air quality metrics.
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and outlier treatment.
Visualization: Graphs and charts that illustrate pollution trends and air quality variations across regions.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning models to predict air quality levels and analyze the impact of key pollutants.

Datasets:
The datasets used for this project are sourced from government and environmental agencies. The data includes air quality index (AQI), pollutant concentrations, and related metrics across various locations.
